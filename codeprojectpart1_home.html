   <h1>About Charlotte Coffee Company </h1>
   <p><strong>Charlotte Coffee Company</strong> was first established in Cornelius, NC, during winter of 2013. 
	  Our founder, Don Johnson, and his wife Pamela were discussing how a good cup of coffee requires just the 
	  right mixture of water and coffee beans to get the best taste. 
	  From that simple conversation, Charlotte Coffee Company was started.
	  Charlotte Coffee Company was the first specialty coffee shop in the Lake Norman area that offered pour-over, 
	  French Press, Aeropress, and over 5 different espresso single origin or blends for our customers to choose from.</p>

	<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
	<p>Here at Charlotte Coffee Company, we take great pride in the quality of the work we do, 
	knowing that we provide our customers with a top notch product.
	Every single batch of coffee we roast in our brand new Probat Roaster is first tested at 
	different temperature levels and different drop points to determine the best characteristic for 
	that type of coffee. All of our coffee then gets tested in our state-of-the-art facility before it
	is sent out to our partners. We have the ability to test all of our coffee using multiple brewing 
	methods right at our facility, so we know exactly how the coffee will taste not just during the 
	cupping session. Join us and begin exploring the possible.</p>
